# Neural Network to Stocks Volume Prediction

This project involves the development of a neural network-based system to predict the volume of stock trading. The structure of the project is as follows:

- `data/`: Directory to store raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `src/`: Source code of the project.
    - `__init__.py`: Makes `src` a Python package.
    - `data.py`: Scripts to load and preprocess data.
    - `features.py`: Scripts for feature engineering.
    - `model.py`: Neural network model definitions.
    - `train.py`: Script for model training.
    - `evaluate.py`: Script for evaluation and testing the model.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
    - `__init__.py`: Makes `tests` a Python package.
    - `test_data.py`: Tests for the data module.
- `star_project/`: Folder and files builder.
